# perch-foundation-templates
Some templates for using Foundation 6 with Perch.

These templates should be added to your Perch or Perch Runway installation by placing them into `perch/templates/content`.

You can see a video and blog post demonstrating how these were created over on the [Perch website](https://grabaperch.com/blog/archive/perch-and-the-foundation-6-framework-building-a-portfolio-layout/).

If you have created some Foundation 6 templates for Perch please submit a Pull Request and we can add them to this resource.
